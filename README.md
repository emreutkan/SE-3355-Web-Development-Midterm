# SE-3355 Web Development Midterm Project - E-commerce Landing Page

This project is a responsive e-commerce landing page created for the SE-3355 Web Development Midterm. The implementation is modeled after a popular Turkish e-commerce platform (Hepsiburada) 

## Assumptions


- All clickable elements redirect to the original Hepsiburada website.
- I assumed that images for the sliders, quick links, products, and electronics section were provided by the backend. Since we couldn't mock image hosting/retrieval logic using a mock API, I added images to the project source and used [mocky.io](https://mocky.io) to return the image link as a relative path. This was done instead of linking directly to Hepsiburada images, which may be deleted in the future.

## Features

- **Responsive Navigation Menu** â€“ A sticky menu with dropdown submenu items  
- **Quick Links Section** â€“ Campaign cards fetched from mock API  
- **Main Product Slider** â€“ Carousel featuring products and campaigns  
- **Electronics Deals Section** â€“ Rotating products with prices every 3 seconds  
- **Personalized Recommendations** â€“ Product cards with price and review ratings  

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (ES6+) 
- Fetch API  
- [mocky.io](https://mocky.io) for simulating backend APIs
